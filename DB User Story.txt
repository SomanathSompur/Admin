Title: Developing Database Micro Service for Seamless Integration

As a software developer tasked with backend development for our online shopping app,

I want to create a robust DB - SQL on AWS Micro Service,

So that we can efficiently manage and organize data for all essential micro services, laying the foundation for a scalable and integrated system.

1. Endpoint for Storing User Information: (Users Micro Service)

The DB - SQL on AWS Micro Service should provide an endpoint to store user details received from the Users Micro Service.
User data may include information like user ID, name, email, and encrypted passwords for authentication.

Acceptance Criteria:
* The micro service should provide an endpoint (/users) to accept and store user information.
* Valid user details, including but not limited to username, email, and password, should be stored securely in the database.
* The response status code for a successful operation should be 201 (Created).


2. Endpoint for Managing Product Stocks: (Stocks Micro Service)

Develop endpoints to handle the addition, update, and retrieval of stock information received from the Stocks Micro Service.
Ensure that stock information is efficiently stored and can be easily queried.

Acceptance Criteria:
* An endpoint (/stocks) should be available to manage product stocks.
* It should support the addition, update, and retrieval of stock information.
* Real-time stock information for a specific product should be accessible through an endpoint (/stocks/{productId}).
* Responses for successful operations should have appropriate status codes (e.g., 201 for creation, 200 for successful update or retrieval).


3. Endpoint for Processing Orders: (Orders Micro Service)

Create endpoints to manage order information received from the Orders Micro Service.
This includes storing order details, updating order statuses, and retrieving order history.

Acceptance Criteria:
* The micro service should expose an endpoint (/orders) for processing orders.
* It should support the creation of new orders and the updating of order statuses.
* Order history for a user should be retrievable via an endpoint (/orders/history/{userId}).
* Responses for successful operations should have appropriate status codes.


4. Endpoint for Address Information: (Address Micro Service)

Implement endpoints for storing and retrieving user addresses from the Address Micro Service.
Address information should be linked to user profiles for accurate order processing.

Acceptance Criteria:
* The micro service should have an endpoint (/addresses) for storing and retrieving user addresses.
* Address information should include details like street, city, and postal code.
* Responses for successful operations should have appropriate status codes.


5. Endpoint for Cart Management: (Cart Micro Service)

Develop endpoints to handle shopping cart information received from the Cart Micro Service.
Ensure that the cart data is stored securely and can be easily updated as users add or remove items.

Acceptance Criteria:
* An endpoint (/carts) should be available for managing shopping carts.
* It should allow the storage and retrieval of shopping cart information.
* The current shopping cart for a user should be retrievable via an endpoint (/carts/{userId}).
* Responses for successful operations should have appropriate status codes.


6. Endpoint for Search Queries: (Search Micro Service)

Create endpoints to store and retrieve product information received from the Search Micro Service.
Optimize queries for efficient product search functionality.

Acceptance Criteria:
* The micro service should support a search endpoint (/products/search?q={query}) for product queries.
* Product details, including name, description, and category, should be searchable and retrievable.
* Responses for successful operations should have appropriate status codes.


7. Endpoint for Authentication: (Auth Micro Service)

Integrate with the Auth Micro Service to ensure secure access to the DB - SQL on AWS Micro Service endpoints.
Implement token-based authentication to validate requests.

Acceptance Criteria:
* The micro service should provide endpoints for user authentication, including login (/auth/login) and logout (/auth/logout).
* Successful login should generate an authentication token, and successful logout should invalidate the token.
* Responses for successful operations should have appropriate status codes.


8. Endpoint for Invoice Generation: (Invoice Micro Service)

Develop endpoints to store and retrieve invoice details from the Invoice Micro Service.
Ensure that invoices are associated with the corresponding orders.

Acceptance Criteria:
* The micro service should expose an endpoint (/invoices) for generating and retrieving invoices.
* Invoice details, including order ID and total amount, should be stored securely.
* Responses for successful operations should have appropriate status codes.


9. Error Handling and Logging:

Implement robust error handling mechanisms to provide clear and meaningful error messages.
Set up logging to capture relevant information for debugging and monitoring purposes.

Acceptance Criteria:
* The micro service should handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful error responses.
* Detailed logs should be maintained to aid in debugging and monitoring.
* Responses for error scenarios should have appropriate status codes (e.g., 400 for bad requests, 404 for not found).
